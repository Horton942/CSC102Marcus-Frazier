        <hi>here are the basics of programing</hi>


        <h2>Variables</h2>

        <script>
            // This is a single line comment in Javascript
            /* This is a multiline comment in Javascript */

            // Let's create our first variable
            var firstname = "Marcus";

            // create the variable, set it to an empty string;
            // we will give it a value later
            var lastname = "";

            // the 3rd way to create a variable - this is a valid way of creationg a variable in Javascript
            // DO NOT USE THIS METHOD
            middlename = "Louis";

        </script>

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <Script>
        //this is a javascript function definition; we need to use the keyword function
        //functions are awesome - you write code 1 time and can reuse it throughout your program
        //functions help organize code
        //function names should usually be some sort of action
        //always include the () - sometimes there will be variable(s) in between the () or they may be empty
        //always make sure there are a matching set of curly braces { }
        function runCalc(){ //do not mix ; and {}
            // whatever code is in between the curly braces belongs to this function
            // we will create a variable called num1, amd we are going to give it a default value of 0
            // javascript should assume this is a numeric datatype
            var num1 = 0;
            var num2 = 0;

            // we want to prompt the user dor a number, using the built in Javascript prompt function
            // the prompt function takes an argument (varuable) -  the text that will be shown to the user with the prompt
            // the prompt function returns the value that the user entered in
            // set the num1 variable equal to the value the user entered in

            // do while loop will run at least 1 time, and then can run as 
            // many time as needed; while loops may run 0 times
            do{
                //make the user enter a number; this loop will run untul a number is entered
                num1 = prompt("please enter number 1: "); // most lines of Javascript need a  ; at the end
            // if isNotaNumber is true (they entered text) or the user entered 0 the loop will keep running
            }while(inNaN(num1) || num1 == 0); // this ; is mandatory
            

            // get another number from the user and assign it to the num2 variable
            num1 = prompt("please enter number 2: "); // most lines of Javascript need a  ; at the end

            // let's add num1 and num2 tigether and store that value in the total variable
            // the built in javascript function parseInt makes sure that javascript treats the num1 and num2 variables as Integers (whole numbers)
            var total = parseInt(num1) + ParseInt(num2);

            //call the built un Javascript function called alert - this will show a message to the user 
            // it should show our numbers and the total
            alert("The total of " + num1 + " plus " + num2 + " is " + total)
        }

        // we have created the function, now we need to call it so that the function code will run
        // the () are blank because we din't need to pass any information into this function
        runCalc();

        // the code here does not belong to the function
    </Script>
    
    <h2>decision logic (if/else)</h2>

    <script>
        //creating a variable called age wuth a default value of 5
        // 1 equal sign is assignment, the variable on the left is assigned the value on the right
        var age = 5;

        // 2 egual signs mean check for equality, or does the value on the left side match the value on the right side
        // if statement, test a value, if the test results in true, run the if block of code
        if (){
            // this code will run if the value of the age variable is 5
            alert("age=" + age); 
        }
        else if(age == 6){
            //this code will run if the value if the age variable is 6
            alert("age=" + age);
        }
        // the else statement is a catch-all, it will run if non of the if/else if statements are true
        else{
            // this code will run if the value of the viable is anything other than 5 or 6
            alert("age was not 5 or 6");
        }
    </script>

    <h2>loops </h2>
    <script>
        // loops run code repeatedly
        // they are great for displaying data
        // there are 2 basic types of loops - for loop and while loop

        // for loops are generally used when you know how many times you want the code to run
        // 1st part of our for loop is a counter variable, and we are setting it to a default value of 0
        // 2nd part the condition that the for loop will test on each run
        // the loop will run as long as this condition is true
        // 3rd oart us incrementing the counter variable each time the loop runs
        // i++ is the same thing as i = i + 1
        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            alert("i=" + i);
        }

        // counter varianle, set to a value of 0
        var counter = 0;
        // while loop will run intil the counter is equal to 5
        while(counter < 5){
            //display the value of counter un an alert
            alert("counter=" + counter);

            //increase the value of the counter by 1 everytime the while loop runs
            counter++;
        }

        // while loops are generally used when you do not know how many times you want the code to run
